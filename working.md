## Agile Manifesto 
***

Agile Manifesto Principles | What This Means in Practice
--- | ---
**Individuals and interactions over processes and tools** | Hire candidates who integrate well into the team and foster collaboration — not just those with strong individual technical expertise.
**Working software over comprehensive documentation** | Release a functional product to users before finalizing exhaustive documentation; prioritize early value delivery and feedback.
**Customer collaboration over contract negotiation** | Maintain continuous, open communication with the customer to resolve issues promptly — rather than strictly adhering to initial contractual terms.
**Responding to change over following a plan** | Be willing to discard prior work if a better solution emerges — even if it means rebuilding — to maximize product value.
**While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more** | The right side is still important, but the left takes precedence; avoid black-and-white thinking — adopt a balanced, context-aware mindset.

## Software Development Methodologies Comparison
***
| Method | Pros | Cons | Risks | Example | Suitable Projects / Organizations |
|--------|------|------|-------|---------|-----------------------------------|
| **Waterfall** | Fully finished product at launch; clear timelines, budget, and scope upfront — high transparency for stakeholders. | No going back to previous phases; unsuitable for complex or evolving projects. | Testing occurs late; critical defects may require redoing large portions of work. |Development of a new payment terminal: Security requirements, regulatory compliance (e.g., Central Bank of Russia standards), and functionality are strictly defined from the outset. | Projects with fixed, well-understood requirements where predictability is critical — e.g., defense, healthcare, or construction industries. 
| **V-Model** | Same advantages as Waterfall, but with dedicated testing at each development phase (verification ↔ validation). | Same limitations as Waterfall (inflexibility, late feedback). | Same risks as Waterfall; test plans must be crafted in parallel with requirements — increases upfront effort. | Development of software for medical devices (e.g., MRI control system), where safety and traceability are mandated. | Small-to-medium projects with stable, well-documented requirements unlikely to change. 
| **Incremental Model** | Faster time-to-market, flexibility, easier testing, better risk management via phased delivery. | High planning effort; risk of scope creep or uncontrolled growth ("feature creep"). | Architectural inconsistencies; challenges in managing dependencies between increments. |E-commerce platform development:<br>• Increment 1: Catalog, search, user registration<br>• Increment 2: Shopping cart, checkout, payment<br>• Increment 3: User profile, order history, loyalty program<br>• Increment 4: Social sharing, reviews | Projects needing early ROI, adaptability, and phased risk mitigation — ideal when market feedback is valuable. 
| **Scrum** | High speed, flexibility, adaptability; reduced waste; increased team motivation and ownership. | Complex to adopt; requires high customer involvement; inefficient for routine/maintenance tasks. | Poorly defined user stories; frequent mid-sprint changes; lack of full team engagement. | A startup developing a new mobile app in a rapidly evolving market (e.g., a fitness app adapting to seasonal trends). | Projects with volatile requirements — especially startups, digital products, and innovation-driven teams. 
| **Kanban** | Visual workflow, flexibility, WIP limits, transparency, easy adoption, early bottleneck detection. | Requires high self-organization; less effective for very large teams or long-term strategic planning; heavily dependent on up-to-date visualization. | Board neglect (e.g., outdated cards) drastically reduces effectiveness. | Software development process:<br>• Board columns: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, Testing, Deployment, Done<br>• Tasks: Represented as cards moving across columns<br>• WIP limit: e.g., max 3 cards in In Progres to prevent overload<br>• Analytics: Cycle time tracking via control charts for process optimization | Customer support, IT operations, maintenance, or service teams where responsiveness and flow efficiency matter most (e.g., helpdesk, DevOps, SRE).
